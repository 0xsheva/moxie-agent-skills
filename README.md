## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Get Started

First, fork the repository and then clone it locally to your machine.

Once you cloned the repository, you can setup your environment with the following scripts:

```bash
cd moxie-agent-plugin
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start --characters='characters/moxie.character.json'
```

Once the agent is running, you should see the message to run "pnpm start:client" at the end.
Open another terminal and move to same directory and then run below command and follow the URL to chat to your agent.

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

Once you're all setup, you can start developing your Moxie Creator Agent Skills.

### Create Your First Skills

You can start creating your first Moxie Skills by first creating a separate branch in your forked repository:

```sh
git checkout -b <new-branch>
```

Then, using the template under the `packages/_examples/plugin` folder, you can create a new Creator Agent Skills with the following script:

```sh
cp ./packages/_examples/plugin ./packages/plugin-<skills-name>
```

Make sure to name your skills with the format `plugin-<skills-name>`.

To learn more on how to create your first skill, you can follow this tutorial [here](https://developer.moxie.xyz/creator-agents-and-skills-marketplace/quickstart/create-your-first-skill).

For further customization, you can refer to the Eliza docs [here](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/packages/plugins/#available-plugins) as Creator Agent Skills are simply Eliza Plugins with additional functionalities.

### Register Your Skills to Moxie
